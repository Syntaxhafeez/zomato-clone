# üçΩÔ∏è Zomato Clone

A simple clone of the original Zomato food ordering website, created to demonstrate my web development skills. This project replicates the design and layout of the Zomato website, focusing on its clean user interface and design elements.

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end replica of the Zomato original website, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to practice and showcase my ability to recreate complex web interfaces using modern web technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structured the content and layout of the website.
- **CSS**: Styled the website to match the Zomato website‚Äôs unique and user-friendly design.
- **JavaScript**: Added interactivity and dynamic features to enhance the user experience.

## How to Use

1. **View Code**: You can view the code and related images in the repository.
2. **Copy & Paste**:
   - Create an `index.html` file and paste the HTML code.
   - Create a `style.css` file for the CSS code.
   - Create a `script.js` file for the JavaScript code.
3. **Run Locally**: Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the clone in action.
